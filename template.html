          <p>In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), health is not just the absence of illness, but a constant pursuit of harmony among the patient’s mental, physical and emotional attributes. In contrast to the Western approach of treating a specific symptom, Chinese Medicine focuses on the interconnections and dependencies between our various internal elements and the constant changes around us. Together with our Master, you will learn the fundamentals of TCM while going through a private consultation and suggested treatments such as acupuncture, herbs, acupoints, cupping, moxibustion and tui na massage. Understand how you can foster greater well-being through the concepts of Chinese medicine.</p>
          <p>Our Master, a 30-year veteran practitioner and lecturer of Traditional Chinese Medicine at Hong Kong University, is a former chemistry teacher who became interested in TCM when she could no longer find sustainable solutions to her health issues through the Western approach to medicine.</p>
