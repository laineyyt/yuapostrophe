      <p>We are taught to know all the answers, but sometimes, not knowing it all can lead to something bigger. </p>

      <p>What if someone else’s story were weaved into your own? What if we stepped out for a moment from our busy lives
        and our determined paths to reflect with new knowledge to a different rhythm? What if this city’s hidden identity
        could push us to go beyond with our cultural boundaries/perimeters and replace our certainties with newfound uncertainties?</p>

      <p>Hong Kong is a city that demands attention. It is rapid, strong, a restless energy that spreads in a frenzy,
        incessant cacophony. From the early morning to the deep night subway cars weave through tunnels, taxis race for fares,
        ferries comb the waters, escalators descend thousands of people and stairs lead them back up.
        Densely packed pedestrians move about the city, elevators travel up and down the thousands of skyscrapers that dot the city line.</p>

      <p>It spins a blur of colour and noise till we can no longer see clearly. And in between, the banyan roots squeeze through the
        cement cracks, the underground comes up for air and the saline waves remind us that parts of the city float.
        Like fishermen on their rafts, like tall buildings on reclaimed land. </p>

      <p>Sometimes it will peel open a pink pomelo, sweet and bitter. Or offer up incense sticks, burning like honey cloves and cinnamon.</p>

      <h3>We could stay right here, stay still and watch.</h3>

      <p>Or we could dive into a new adventure and delve into the treasures that the city keeps hidden.
        The insights that it keeps for the curious, the mastery that it keeps for those who search for more. </p>

      <p>Yu’ wants to break through the surface of the city and bring you deep into its philosophical roots.
        To pierce through the screen between us and the unknown, into a place where the city slows down and speaks through its Masters,
        Masters of their craft. Masters of Yin and Yang. We can go into a space where crisp tea leaves blossom in hot water,
        where brittle rice paper cracks under black ink, where pungent herbs line narrow shelves.
        Where you will hear see the brush strokes, smell the tea leaves and taste the bitter herbs. </p>

      <p>To listen to stories and interpret them as your own; to go on a journey where multiple paths could split into new
        unimagined possibilities. And perhaps, in a city that consumes us and feeds us every day,
        eventually find the surprising unknown in yourself.</p>
